# local-agent

This repository contains the front-end and back-end code for a ChatGPT-like agent that uses Vercel v0 for the UI and various coding AI models (e.g., Codex, Ollama) for backend logic. The goal is to create a cheap yet powerful agent that can interact with websites, run code, and provide responses similar to ChatGPT.
